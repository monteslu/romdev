# Changelog

All notable changes to `romdev-mcp`. Dates are release dates.

## 0.3.1

Homebrew/asset-import polish from a Genesis platformer session, plus a Genesis
sprite-inspection bug fix.

### Added
- **`wavToXgm2Pcm`** — convert a WAV (or raw s16le PCM) into a Genesis XGM2 PCM
  sample: 8-bit signed mono, 13.3 kHz (or 6.65 half-rate), 256-byte-padded, plus a
  256-aligned C array + `<NAME>_LEN` define ready to `#include` and `XGM2_playPCM`.
  Bakes in the fiddly sign/rate/alignment/padding rules.
- **`convertImageToTiles`** now takes `pngPath` (reads the PNG from disk — no base64
  token cost or hand-forwarding corruption) and `tileOrder:'sprite'` (column-major,
  the order multi-cell hardware sprites read on Genesis/Lynx).

### Changed
- **`imageToTilemap`** (Genesis) now warns when a visible dominant color is forced
  to palette index 0 (transparent on a scroll plane → renders as the backdrop).
- **`recordAudio`** description now cross-references `getAudioState` (WAV is to
  HEAR; getAudioState is to ASSERT), and notes getAudioState doesn't cover Genesis
  PCM-channel activity yet. Genesis MENTAL_MODEL documents the XGM2 PCM rules.

### Fixed
- **Genesis `inspectSprites` size/position** — a 32×32 sprite decoded as 8×8 (and
  x/y/tile/palette could be wrong) because the SAT words were read big-endian;
  gpgx stores VRAM host-little-endian (byte-swapped). Fixed in the live sprite,
  plane-preview, and which-tiles decoders.

## 0.3.0

The reverse-engineering / romhacking release — a full RE toolkit driven by a real
NBA Jam Tournament Edition (Genesis) session, plus PC Engine + MSX cheat coverage
and a cleaner package split.

### Added — RE / romhacking toolkit
- **`searchValue` / `searchNext`** — the iterative value-search loop (Cheat-Engine
  / RetroArch cheat search): seed candidate addresses for an on-screen value, then
  narrow with `eq`/`gt`/`lt`/`changed`/`unchanged`/`inc`/`dec` as the value changes.
  The bread-and-butter "find the address of X" primitive. Works on all 14 platforms.
- **`readCartRom`** — read the loaded cartridge ROM image to confirm a patch is
  actually running. For un-banked platforms (Genesis, GB/GBC, SMS/GG, PCE, Lynx,
  Atari, C64) a file offset equals the CPU ROM address; NES/SNES skip the header
  and flag `mapped:true` (bytes correct, mapper-banked).
- **`classifyRegion`** — heuristic ("looks like ascii-text / high-entropy /
  tile-data / structured-data") that flags when a "found table" is really an ASCII
  string, killing the coincidental-match trap before a broken patch ships.
- **`navigate`** — drive menus by advancing on SCREEN CHANGE instead of fixed frame
  waits, reporting per-press whether it was `consumed`. 5–10× faster, deterministic
  menu scripting.
- **`traceVramSource`** (Genesis) — report which ROM offset a VRAM graphic was DMA'd
  from (decoded from the VDP DMA registers). Answers "this name/logo is a
  pre-rendered bitmap — where in ROM is it?".
- **`searchCheats`** — fuzzy game-name search over the cheat DB (no full-DB dump).
- **ROM-hacking playbook** — cross-platform RE/patching decision tree, readable via
  `getPlatformDoc({platform:'romhacking', name:'playbook'})`.

### Added — platforms / data
- **PC Engine** and **MSX** cheat-database coverage (397 + 377 games).
- **`romdev_game_codes`** — the cheat database is now its own package (lazy-loaded one
  platform at a time), shrinking the main package while letting the DB grow
  independently. Still a required dependency, so `npx romdev-mcp` ships with cheats.

### Changed
- **`learnFontMap`** now detects and reports pre-rendered tile graphics
  (`likelyPreRenderedGraphic`) instead of failing silently on non-font "text".
- **`diffMemory`** defaults to a clustered summary (changed ranges + stride
  detection — "islands at stride 0x80 ⇒ likely a struct array") instead of dumping
  thousands of per-byte rows; `view:'raw'` for the exact list.
- **`findWriter` / `watchMemory`** now hint, on no per-byte write, that the region
  may be bulk-copied/DMA'd (sprite shadow, display list, VRAM) — watch the source
  struct, not the destination.
- **`screenshot`** with `inline:true` now also writes a temp PNG and returns its
  path, so follow-up ImageMagick crops don't ENOENT.
- **`gameCheats`** fuzzy-matches a ROM name to the DB (region/revision tag tolerant).

### Fixed
- **Genesis CRAM color decode** — colors rendered blue-on-black; the decoder now
  reads the packed 9-bit little-endian CRAM correctly.

## 0.2.0

- PC Engine and MSX added as Tier-1 platforms (14 total).
- Server/livestream show the version, sourced from `package.json`.
